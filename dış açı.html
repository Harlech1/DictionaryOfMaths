    <p> exterior angle (in a polygon); outer angle
(in a circle)</p>
<p>An exterior angle of a polygon is an angle formed by a side and an
extension of an adjacent side . Since there are two directions in which
a side can be extended, there are two congruent exterior angles at each
vertex.</p>
<p>The measure of each exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum
of measures of its two remote interior</p>
<p>angles.</p>
