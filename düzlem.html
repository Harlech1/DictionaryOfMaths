    <p> plane</p>
<p>A plane is a set of points.It is a flat surface that has no
thickness. Each plane divides the space into two parts.</p>
<p>A plane extends without end, even though its drawing appears to have
edges.</p>
<p>Through any three noncollinear points there exists exactly one
plane.</p>
<p>Two intersecting lines determine exactly one plane. It has two
dimensions.</p>
<p>Two parallel lines determine exactly one plane. A line and a point
not on that line determine exactly one plane.</p>
<p>If two planes intersect, then they intersect in exactly one line. Two
planes that do not intersect are parallel planes.</p>
<p>If two points lie in a plane , then the line containing them lies in
the plane.</p>
