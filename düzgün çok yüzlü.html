    <p> regular polyhedron</p>
<p>It is a convex polyhedron in which all of the faces are congruent
regular polygons, with the same number of</p>
<p>faces meeting at each vertex . They are also called platonic solids
after the Greek philosopher Plato.The five</p>
<p>platonic solids are :</p>

<p> regular hexahedron; cube (6
faces , 8 vertices, and 12 edges)</p>
<p> regular
tetrahedron; regular triangular pyramid ( 4 faces , 4 vertices, and 6
edges)</p>
<p> regular dodecahedron (12 faces ,
20 vertices, and 30 edges)</p>
<p> regular octahedron (8 faces , 6
vertices, and 12 edges)</p>
<p> regular icosahedron (20 faces ,
12 vertices, and 30 edges)</p>
